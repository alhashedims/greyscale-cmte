# Greyscale UI

A theme for the CyanogenMod theme engine.

Greyscale is a simple and minimal theme built for CyanogenMod 13.x, it features an AOSP-like design and a Material Grey palette. This project aims to be a playground and a solid template for my future themes (and yours hopefully).

## What's themed
* __Status bar__
* __Navigation bar__
* __Style__
  * Framework-res
  * Settings
  * AOSP Keyboard 
  * Google Keyboard
  * Trebuchet 
  * Downloads Provider
  * Calculator
  * CMUpdater
  * Theme Chooser
  * AudioFX

I don't plan theming 3rd party apps others than Google Keyboard, sorry. I just don't have time to deal with app updates and I like to keep this theme minimal and "stockish".

### CM12.x Support
CyanogenMod 12.x is not supported due to some assets relying on Android 6 API. Future support is not planned at the moment since less and less people are using CM12.x, and it's simply not worth to scrap some fancy features of this theme just to make it installable on older versions. Yet, you're free to modify the theme yourself and make it work on CM12.x devices.

## TODO
* dark variant (work in progress, see module themedark)
* add some nice custom fonts
* theme battery icon
* Arcus support
* CM14 support
